# Description

### WARNING: Breaking changes from v3.x - that script is now using the item id and not anymore the item name, read the container name pattern doc to know how to find it if you are looking for the v3.x version, you can still find it here: https://github.com/jericho1060/du-storage-monitoring/tree/v3.x but it won't be updated anymore

It's displaying on a screen the quantity and the percent fill of containers or hub.

It can support up to 9 screens and chose what is display on each (group feature)

To add a container to the system, you must rename it following that pattern: `<prefix>_<itemId>`
For a Hub, you must use that pattern: `<prefix>_<itemId>_<containserSize>_<amountOfContainers>`

- `<prefix>`: the prefix that enable monitoring, by default `s1_` for the 1st screen, `s2_` for the second, and so on (see below for all options), see options to customize it
- `<itemId>`: The ID of the item in the game database, you can search the ID of item here: https://du-lua.dev/#/items
- `<containerSize>`: if a hub, the size of the containers linked (default to XS), valid options are `xs`, `s`, `m`, `l`, `xl`, `xxl` (this is not needed for containers, only for hubs)
- `<amountOfContainers>`: if a hub, the amount of containers linked (this is not needed for containers, only for hubs)

**example for coal:**

The item id is `299255727` 
- if it's for a container, you must name it `s1_299255727`
- if it's for a hub, you must name it `s1_299255727_s_4` (4 containers of size S)

By default, the script is grouping all containers or hub that contains the same items on a single line and add the values. See option if you want to disable it.

By default, the list is sorted by item tier and then by name

# Installation
